Greetings!

I study Financial Mathematics with a year in industry at University of Kent, currently in my second year. Here, I will be regularly updating my portfolio and you'd find why I will be the right employee for your company :D

[**Here is my Linkedin for the insight**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-zhu-1868b11b7/).



# Personal Projects

These are projects that are either incomplete or complete. I chose to do them in my spare time because I further wanted to see how far my knowledge can go. Half are based around statistical modelling in R and excel, some are game development based and others are very trivial exploring areas that are not within my comfort zone such as artificial intelligence. 

## EXCEL ISA INVESTMENT CALCULATOR (INCOMPLETE)

*This is an excel spreadsheet that has a function generating random scenarios, then writing a metric that runs thousands of times that you can use to calculate probabilities. Could be something financial like wanting to invest X each year in an ISA. You don't know whether to invest X at the start of each year or X/12 each month. Investing sooner will make more on average but there's the risk that the one day you invest is that one day when the market's high. I'd Build a spreadsheet that does it both ways. Randomise investment returns as well as building a macro to run it thousands of times and look at the probability distributions come out like got what it's all worth after ten years.

### Project Initiation Plan 

*I will be using **VLOOKUP** and **RAND** to determine the investment return for each investment day and create a separate table for the output values. The **IF** function will be used for each investment option, the **AVERAGE** will calculate the average total investment return over the amount of random scenarios generated. **CHART** will create a probability distribution chart for the data visuals. 


## EXCEL FOOTBALL SCORE PREDICTOR (INCOMPLETE)

*Poisson distribution for scores in football matches that depends on the two teams playing. Maybe each team has an expected goals for and against at home and away and when A is at home to B, A's goals are Poisson with average of A's home expectation and B's away expectation, etc. get a spreadsheet to generate random results and work out probability of home win, away win and draw for one particular match.

### Project Initation Plan

*Functions being used : **RANDBETWEEN** for home and away teams to be chosen into two columns seprating the variables, **VLOOPUP** to look up the expected goals for each team based on whether they are playing home or away. **POISSON** is self-explanatory. **COUNT-IF** is used for combinatorics. **CHART** is for data visuals for patterns and trends.
