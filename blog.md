I started DJing in my first year of university, when I started out I was nervous as hell. It was this geezer called Harry in his final year doing politics and was the vice president of the DJ society hosting tutorials showing newbies like me how to beatmatch and what not. We'd book out an empty classroom for an hour, bring a pair of presonus speakers and DDJ 400 pioneers. Each person takes a turn beatmatching 2-3 songs and repeat. Society died out after Christmas, Harry couldn't care less anymore and Tristian the founder resigned because he didn't see a future at all with it. As far as the gossip goes, there was a lot of conflict and distress among how the society should be ran. 

2nd year jogged on and Anna voted herself to be president, her plans were to make the DJ society look really fancy and pretty. Her idea was a pretty colourful image would attract people, in fact she had no idea on how organizations were ran or how marketing works, she studies bloody sociology and in meetings she had no clue what she was talking about, she was too naive thinking we could book big DJs and get gigs at big venues just by making our posters look extremely colourful and be a wannabe Kim Kardashian on instagram. Only 1 event happened in October and it was for a charity. I had only found out the DJ society was a charity itself and none of the revenue we'd generate from gigs would go to us so I thought you know what the society needs a takeover. 

It was end of the autumn term and approaching mid december, I quit my job at the local nightclub over tax and mental health issues and Bryn invited me out for a pint. I had a long deep chat with him on how the society should be ran and we'd both mutually agreed to start our own independent brand that would play various genres and get small gigs at smaller clubs. Ethan Cox liked the idea and came up with the name "Sounds Of The Underground" for the brand. We'd launched our brand and made £25 each on the door, we'd agreed to do it at the end of each month and it had steadily grown. It grew to £40 the second night, £60 the third night and the last one I recently did at end of March we made an atonishing £300!! The locals were loving it and word of mouth gets around. Now I'd have to smash these exams in May and get ready for the next one planned to be in early June. Suns out, beers out!
